For UI Run the command - npm start - UI is at port 8080

For API - Run the file - node api/server.js - API is on port 5001

After starting both UI and API Open Browser and open http://localhost:8080

There you will find two routes

AddProducts
ProductsList

Add Products I tried to do so that I can add the products using Moltin API Reference and list them in the products. But I failed as understaning Moltin API was taking some time.

The curl operations worked i was getting token however when i tried to do from postman or code it started giving 415 status code which i solved by passing content type later i was getting 422 status code couldnt understand where it was going wrong better to have sample request contract but as time was less I moved on by mocking all the api contracts.
